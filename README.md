# Python Practice

This repository contains various Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and Python features.

## Files Overview

### 1. `Augmented_assignment_oprator.py`

Demonstrates augmented assignment operators in Python (+=, -=, etc.) which provide a shorter way to update variables with operations.

### 2. `Data_types_0.py`

An overview of Python's basic data types including:

- Integers
- Floats
- Booleans
- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Classes and specialized data types

### 3. `Expressions_and_statments.py`

Explains the difference between expressions (code that produces a value) and statements (complete lines of code) in Python.

### 4. `Numbers0.py`

Covers fundamental operations with numbers in Python:

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /, \*\*, //, %)
- Type checking with `type()`
- Math functions like `round()` and `abs()`
- Binary conversion with `bin()`

### 5. `numbers1(BIN and Complex).py`

Explores more advanced number concepts:

- Complex numbers and operations
- Binary number representation
- Converting between binary and decimal

### 6. `Oprator_precedence.py`

Demonstrates the order of operations (operator precedence) in Python with examples showing how different expressions are evaluated.

### 7. `strings_.py`

Covers string basics in Python:

- String creation with single and double quotes
- Multi-line strings with triple quotes
- String concatenation
- String variables

### 8. `variables_.py`

Explains Python variables:

- Variable naming conventions and rules
- Snake case naming
- Constants
- Multiple variable assignment
- Dunder methods

## Getting Started

To run any of these scripts, use Python 3:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

For example:

```bash
python Numbers0.py
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
